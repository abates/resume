\textsc{Graduate Thesis} \hfill \textsc{January 2012} - \textsc{December 2014} \\
Currently working on a Graduate Thesis as the final requirement for a Master of
Science degree in Computer Science.  The thesis attempts to improve upon
clustering techniques used for clustering short texts, specifically Twitter
status updates.  Supporting scripts (for various data manipulation) are written
in Perl and Ruby while the majority of natural language processing (NLP) and
clustering is written in Java.  Technologies used include Apache Mahout for
datamining/clustering, Apache Hadoop for map reduce and Apache Lucene for
various text parsing and NLP activities.  Research topics include K-Means
clustering, Gap Statistic for counting clusters and hybrid or sentence based
term frequency/inverse document frequency based term weighting.
